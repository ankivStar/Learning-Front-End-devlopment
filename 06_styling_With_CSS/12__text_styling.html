    <p id="sample-para"> Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. While automation can take care of things such as optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you will also learn to use your time to focus on the areas thatâ€™ll improve the overall functionality of your site.  Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very efficient automation tools.</p>
